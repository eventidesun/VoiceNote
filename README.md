# VoiceNote

## Description
VoiceNote is an AI-powered note-taking application that transcribes and summarizes conversations into notes. Itâ€™s designed to help users who are hard of hearing, forgetful, or need a quick and efficient way to note down important information during meetings, lectures, or medical appointments.

## Creation 
This project was made in CS 3307 for a group project. Some of the files are removed so they are not used and others are removed as they are too large (such as Whisper.cpp and llama.cpp).
