# VoiceNote

## Description
VoiceNote is an AI-powered note-taking application that transcribes and summarizes conversations into notes. Itâ€™s designed to help users who are hard of hearing, forgetful, or who need a quick and efficient way to capture important information during meetings, lectures, or medical appointments.

## Creation 
This project was developed as part of CS 3307 for a group project. Some files have been removed because they were not needed or because they were too large to include in this repository (e.g., Whisper.cpp and Llama.cpp model files).
